Preface
=======

Please see `/api/README.md` and `/ui/README.md` for more details.

Notes
=====

- The entire project (both sections, `/api/` and `/ui/`) is sparsely commented due to time constraints.

- The standard features of a registration system such as **Forgot Password** have been omitted due to time constraints.

- The UI has been tested in the following browsers:
    - Chrome
    - Firefox

- The input values `distance` and `time` are stored in `meters` and `seconds` respectively (in the database).

- `/api/` contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests.

- `/ui/` contains a far more simpler suite of unit tests. It would be as comprehensive as `/api/` with the addition of integration/E2E tests.
